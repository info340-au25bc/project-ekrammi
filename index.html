            <h2><strong> Overview:</strong></h2>
            <p>For out Web App project, we decided on creating an all round pilates website.
                Our website will include features such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>Client Dashboard</li>
                    <li>Instructor Profile and review</li>
                    <li> payment and billing dashboard </li>
                    <li> booking and canceling </li>
                    <li> responsive interface (frontend and backend) </li>

                </ul>

            </p>

            <h2><strong>Problem / Data Domain</strong></h2>
          
            <p>
              Small Pilates studios frequently have attractive websites, but they don't give users access to the information they need, such as which sessions are still available, who is teaching, and how to make a quick reservation or cancel.
              A lot of studios still use forms that are sent to staff members inboxes, emails or phone calls.
              This slows down operations, causes errors, and drives away potential customers.
              Although schedules vary daily, many websites are just static flyers rather than interactive resources.

              The core issue is that users aren't given access to class data (time, level, capacity, teacher, reservations, and waitlists) in a way that allows them to filter and take immediate action.
              Individuals wish to select a class that suits their schedule and skill level, reserve a space and handle that reservation without contacting the studio.
              This can be resolved by the large platforms now in use, but small studios find them costly and complicated. It is not resolved at all by static websites.

              Pilates improves the posture, strength and flexibility

              Existing platforms like
              <a href="https://classpass.com/search" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ClassPass</a>
              This lets users schedule exercise courses, although they prioritize large studio networks.
              The goal of our project is to make it simpler for clients of small Pilates studios to browse schedules, make class reservations, and oversee their sessions.
